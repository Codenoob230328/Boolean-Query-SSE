# Cash13SSE
This is a prototype implementaiton of Cash 13 paper [1]. It is implemented by using java with package JPBC [2].

I have impleneted the three SSE schemes that proposed in [1]: Single Keyword Search (SKS), Basic Cross-Tags Protocol (BXT) and Oblivious Cross-Tags Protocol (OXT). 

In the src fold, there are several packages which implement the aforementioned protocols: sks is the SKS, bxt is the BXT and oxt is the OXT. util is the package that used to store some basic tools that used in this project.

# Usage

Import this project to eclipse/myeclipse directly. Then, you can run the schemes under the src fold.
