# Cash13SSE
This is a prototype implementaiton of Cash 13 paper [1]. It is implemented by using java with package JPBC [2].

In the src fold, there are several SSE schemes in Cash 13 paper, where sks is the single keyword search, bxt is the basic cross tag search and the oxt is the oblivious cross tag search.

# Usage

Import this project to eclipse/myeclipse directly. Then, you can run the schemes under the src fold.
